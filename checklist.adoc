== Current System Analysis
*What we're working with*


* [ ] 2.1 *P1* Have we thoroughly analyzed and documented the current system architecture and dependencies?

* [ ] 2.2 *P1* Do we understand the data models and their business relevance?

* [ ] 2.3 *P1* Do we know which legacy features are still used vs. obsolete?

* [ ] 2.4 *P1* Have we identified cross-cutting concerns (logging, security, etc.) that need redesign?

* [ ] 2.5 *P2* Do we understand integration points with other systems and their migration impacts?

* [ ] 2.6 *P2* Have we analyzed current operations, monitoring, and support processes for the legacy system? 

* [ ] 2.7 *P2* Have we identified technical debt that should be addressed during migration?

* [ ] 2.8 *P2* Have we evaluated security risks in both the legacy and target systems?

* [ ] 2.9 *P2* Have we traced data flows to original sources rather than assuming the legacy system is the source of truth?

NOTE: Often better data exists at original source systems that was lost or degraded when passed to legacy systems.

* [ ] 2.10 *P2* Have we identified any critical aggregators (reporting functions crucial to running the business)?

NOTE: Reports or data aggregation processes that executives rely on to run the business, which often become bottlenecks in migrations.

* [ ] 2.11 *P3* Have we analyzed how current business processes are shaped by legacy system constraints?

* [ ] 2.12 *P3* Have we explored potential event interception points (messaging, APIs, databases) to enable incremental migration?

*Identify locations where you can intercept data flows between systems to gradually redirect processing to new components.*

> **Facilitator Note:** Don't get lost too deep into technical details in the workshop. Focus on understanding the big picture and identifying what needs deeper analysis.

---

== Stakeholder Needs
*Who's affected & what they actually need*


* [ ] 3.1 *P1* Have we identified all relevant stakeholder groups (end users, business departments, IT, etc.)?

* [ ] 3.2 *P1* Have we gathered input from end customers on their needs and pain points?

* [ ] 3.3 *P1* Have we engaged with sales/customer service teams to understand customer expectations?

* [ ] 3.4 *P1* Do we have a communication plan to keep stakeholders informed throughout the migration?

* [ ] 3.5 *P1* Have we established feedback channels for continuous stakeholder input?

* [ ] 3.6 *P2* Have we conducted interviews or observation sessions with frontline employees?

* [ ] 3.7 *P2* Have we analyzed support tickets and common user complaints?

* [ ] 3.8 *P2* Have we engaged with finance teams to understand revenue impacts of different products/features?

* [ ] 3.9 *P2* Have we defined communication cadence and key milestone updates for different stakeholder groups throughout the migration?

NOTE: Different stakeholders need different update frequencies - executives might need monthly updates while end users need more frequent communication during their migration phases.

* [ ] 3.10 *P2* Have we established escalation protocols for communicating migration issues or delays to stakeholders?

NOTE: Define when and how to communicate problems, who needs to be informed first, and what level of detail different groups require.

* [ ] 3.11 *P3* Have we identified off-system workarounds (spreadsheets, access databases, etc.) that have evolved around legacy limitations?

* [ ] 3.12 *P3* Have we involved stakeholders in identifying meaningful ways to slice the migration?

NOTE: Work with business experts to break down the system into logical segments that can be migrated independently, focusing on business value rather than technical boundaries.

* [ ] 3.13 *P2* Do we have a plan for celebrating migration milestones and communicating wins to maintain stakeholder engagement?

NOTE: Migration projects can be long - plan for recognizing progress and maintaining momentum through regular success communication.

> **Facilitator Note:** Technical teams often underestimate stakeholder complexity. Help them understand that "users" includes many different groups with different needs.

---

== Organizational Constraints
*Reality check*

* [ ] 4.8 *P2* Have we budgeted for the potential parallel running of critical systems during transition phases?

* [ ] 4.9 *P3* Have we allocated resources for implementing and eventually removing transitional architecture components?

* [ ] 4.10 *P3* Have we accounted for the time needed to collaborate with business on identifying migration slices?

NOTE: Ensure the schedule includes dedicated time for workshops to analyze and define meaningful migration increments.

> **Facilitator Note:** Be realistic about constraints. Technical teams tend to be optimistic about timelines and underestimate the complexity of organizational coordination.

== Quality Goals
*What matters most*


* [ ] 5.1 *P1* Have we identified the top 3-5 most important quality goals for this migration?

* [ ] 5.2 *P1* Have we aligned quality goals with key stakeholder concerns and business drivers?

* [ ] 5.10 *P3* Do we have a plan for implementing continuous delivery practices that might have been promised in the business case?

> **Facilitator Note:** Quality goals should be specific and measurable, not generic "better performance." Help the team connect quality attributes to real business outcomes.

---

== Technical Constraints
*Technical stuff we can't change*


* [ ] 6.1 *P1* Have we identified legacy interfaces that must be maintained during and after migration?

* [ ] 6.2 *P1* Do we understand technology stack requirements or limitations?

* [ ] 6.3 *P1* Have we mapped integration points with external systems?

* [ ] 6.4 *P1* Do we know infrastructure and deployment constraints we must work within?

* [ ] 6.5 *P2* Have we evaluated what regulatory or compliance requirements constrain our technical choices?

* [ ] 6.6 *P2* Do we understand data residency or sovereignty requirements?

NOTE: Where data must be stored, how it can be processed, and which laws apply to it based on geographic location.

* [ ] 6.7 *P2* Have we identified any vendor lock-in situations that limit our options?

* [ ] 6.8 *P2* Do we know what existing licenses or contracts affect our technology choices?

* [ ] 6.9 *P3* Have we evaluated the impact of existing monitoring and operational tooling on our choices?

* [ ] 6.10 *P3* Do we understand network and security constraints that may affect the new architecture?

> **Facilitator Note:** Technical constraints are often the most comfortable area for technical teams, but don't let them get stuck here. Keep the focus on constraints that truly limit options.

---

== Migration Strategy
*How we're going to do this*


* [ ] 7.1 *P1* Have we designed an iterative/incremental approach that reduces risk?

* [ ] 7.2 *P1* Have we identified suitable candidates for early migration?

NOTE: Considering both high-value components and low-hanging fruit, with clear criteria for what constitutes meaningful early wins (e.g. 10% revenue threshold)?

* [ ] 7.3 *P1* Do we have a data migration strategy that ensures business continuity?

* [ ] 7.4 *P1* Have we explicitly ruled out big bang approaches in favor of incremental migration?

* [ ] 7.5 *P1* Have we explored different slicing approaches?

NOTE: Consider options like migrating by product line, user group, business capability, or user journey to find the most effective approach.

* [ ] 7.6 *P1* Have we planned for parallel operations during transition if needed?

* [ ] 7.7 *P1* Have we considered tackling critical aggregators (essential reports/functions) early rather than last? Which?

NOTE: Consider replacing critical reports first rather than leaving them until the end where they can block complete migration.

* [ ] 7.8 *P1* Have we avoided the feature parity trap by focusing on business needs rather than replicating all existing functionality?

NOTE: Resist the temptation to simply recreate the existing system with newer technology.

* [ ] 7.9 *P1* Have we considered implementing frequent delivery practices from the beginning of the migration to validate future delivery capabilities?

* [ ] 7.10 *P2* Have we defined rollback procedures in case of migration issues?

* [ ] 7.11 *P2* Do we have a plan for handling legacy system maintenance during migration?

* [ ] 7.12 *P2* Have we established a testing strategy for verifying functionality post-migration?

* [ ] 7.13 *P2* Have we planned for performance and load testing at each migration phase to ensure the new system can handle production workloads?

NOTE: Consider testing both individual migrated components and the overall system performance as load shifts between old and new systems.

* [ ] 7.14 *P2* Do we have a strategy for testing data integrity and consistency between old and new systems during parallel operations?

NOTE: Include plans for automated data reconciliation checks and handling of data discrepancies during transition.

* [ ] 7.15 *P3* Have we explored applying the Strangler Fig and Bridge to the New Town patterns to gradually replace functionality?

NOTE: Patterns where new functionality gradually takes over from legacy code by intercepting calls (Strangler Fig) or through intermediate connecting layers during transition (Bridge to the New Town). When deciding for a pattern like Strangler Fig, also consider that while functionality migration may be straightforward, data migration complexity can be significantly higher.

* [ ] 7.16 *P3* Have we designed necessary transitional architecture components with clear plans for their eventual removal?

NOTE: Temporary components needed during migration that should be removed once they're no longer needed.

> **Facilitator Note:** Migration strategy often generates the most debate. Focus on establishing principles (incremental, value-driven) rather than detailed execution plans in the workshop.

* [ ] 8.14 *P3* Have we decided on monitoring and observability approaches for the migration process?

* [ ] 8.15 *P3* Have we chosen our approach to feature flags or configuration management during transition?

* [ ] 8.16 *P3* Are we "building as we mean to continue" with the same practices we want post-migration?

NOTE: If the goal is to release every two weeks post-migration, start releasing every two weeks during migration.

* [ ] 8.17 *P3* Do we have a plan to eventually decommission any remaining legacy components?

* [ ] 8.18 *P3* Have we designed our testing approach to validate that migrated functionality performs equivalently to legacy systems under real-world conditions?

NOTE: Beyond functional testing, ensure performance, reliability, and user experience match or exceed legacy system capabilities.

* [ ] 8.19 *P3* Have we considered approaches for parallel performance measurement and validation (such as tools like GitHub Scientist) to compare old and new system behavior under real conditions?

> **Facilitator Note:** Focus on decisions that can't be easily changed later. Avoid getting bogged down in implementation details that can be refined during execution.

* [ ] 9.13 *P2* Have we avoided heavyweight change processes that contradict our future delivery goals?

* [ ] 9.14 *P3* Have we addressed the organizational behaviors that led to the legacy situation in the first place?

NOTE: Consider what patterns of decision-making or organizational culture contributed to the legacy situation and how to change them.

> **Facilitator Note:** Risk identification often reveals gaps in earlier analysis. Use risks to validate previous sections and identify areas needing more detailed planning.

* [ ] 10.7 *P2* Have we documented terminology differences to ensure consistent understanding?

* [ ] 10.8 *P3* Have we re-evaluated the assumption that all systems need to be consolidated rather than some retired?

> **Facilitator Note:** System consolidation adds significant complexity. If applicable, ensure these questions get P1 attention as they fundamentally impact migration strategy.
